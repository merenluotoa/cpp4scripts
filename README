CPP4Scripts README file
Version 0.9

   I have chosen to have the instructions available only on-line. Web site "http://cpp4scripts.menacon.fi" has a
   short programmers guide that explains the use and building of the library. If you need API documentation it is
   available from SourceForge web site "https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpp4scripts/files/" as a zip packaged
   HTML documentation.

Enjoy,

  Antti M.
